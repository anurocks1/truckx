1) I have used four get requests namely getlogin, alarm, location, video and checked if the alerts recieved are valid or not. 
2) If not valid then I have logged out there is an error.
3) I have assumed data types of these get requests are valid.
4) Then I have used a server variable to post type,imei,command from backend to front.
